1- justify content
2- align-items
3- gap
4- flex-direction
5- flex-wrap

Ans- In the Flexbox layout model, several key properties play a crucial role in defining the layout and alignment of flex containers and their items. Here's an explanation of the role of each property:

1. **justify-content:**
   - **Role:** This property defines how the flex items are distributed along the main axis of the flex container.
   - **Values:**
     - `flex-start`: Items are placed at the start of the main axis.
     - `flex-end`: Items are placed at the end of the main axis.
     - `center`: Items are centered along the main axis.
     - `space-between`: Items are evenly distributed with the first item at the start and the last item at the end.
     - `space-around`: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around them.
     - `space-evenly`: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around and between them.

2. **align-items:**
   - **Role:** This property defines how the flex items are aligned along the cross axis of the flex container.
   - **Values:**
     - `flex-start`: Items are aligned at the start of the cross axis.
     - `flex-end`: Items are aligned at the end of the cross axis.
     - `center`: Items are centered along the cross axis.
     - `baseline`: Items are aligned such that their baselines align.
     - `stretch`: Items are stretched to fill the container along the cross axis.

3. **gap:**
   - **Role:** This property defines the spacing between flex items within a flex container. It is a shorthand property for `row-gap` and `column-gap` (or just `gap` for both axes in the latest specifications).
   - **Value:** Any length unit or percentage can be used to specify the gap.

4. **flex-direction:**
   - **Role:** This property defines the direction in which the main axis of the flex container points.
   - **Values:**
     - `row`: Main axis is horizontal, and items are placed in a row.
     - `row-reverse`: Main axis is horizontal, but items are placed in a reversed order.
     - `column`: Main axis is vertical, and items are placed in a column.
     - `column-reverse`: Main axis is vertical, but items are placed in a reversed order.

5. **flex-wrap:**
   - **Role:** This property defines whether the flex container should wrap its items onto multiple lines if there isn't enough space along the main axis.
   - **Values:**
     - `nowrap`: All items are forced onto a single line (no wrapping).
     - `wrap`: Items wrap onto multiple lines as necessary.
     - `wrap-reverse`: Items wrap onto multiple lines in the reverse order.

These properties, when used together, allow developers to create flexible and responsive layouts using the Flexbox model, adjusting the alignment, spacing, and direction of items within flex containers.
